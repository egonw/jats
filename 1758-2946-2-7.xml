            <p>OpenTox provides an interoperable, standards-based Framework for the support of predictive toxicology data management, algorithms, modelling, validation and reporting. It is relevant to satisfying the chemical safety assessment requirements of the REACH legislation as it supports access to experimental data, (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship models, and toxicological information through an integrating platform that adheres to regulatory requirements and OECD validation principles. Initial research defined the essential components of the Framework including the approach to data access, schema and management, use of controlled vocabularies and ontologies, architecture, web service and communications protocols, and selection and integration of algorithms for predictive modelling. OpenTox provides end-user oriented tools to non-computational specialists, risk assessors, and toxicological experts in addition to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for developers of new applications. OpenTox actively supports public standards for data representation, interfaces, vocabularies and ontologies, Open Source approaches to core platform components, and community-based collaboration approaches, so as to progress system interoperability goals.</p>
            <p>The OpenTox Framework includes APIs and services for compounds, datasets, features, algorithms, models, ontologies, tasks, validation, and reporting which may be combined into multiple applications satisfying a variety of different user needs. OpenTox applications are based on a set of distributed, interoperable OpenTox API-compliant REST web services. The OpenTox approach to ontology allows for efficient mapping of complementary data coming from different datasets into a unifying structure having a shared terminology and representation.</p>
            <p>Two initial OpenTox applications are presented as an illustration of the potential impact of OpenTox for high-quality and consistent structure-activity relationship modelling of REACH-relevant endpoints: ToxPredict which predicts and reports on toxicities for endpoints for an input chemical structure, and ToxCreate which builds and validates a predictive toxicity model based on an input toxicology dataset. Because of the extensible nature of the standardised Framework design, barriers of interoperability between applications and content are removed, as the user may combine data, models and validation from multiple sources in a dependable and time-effective way.</p>

          <title>1. Background</title>
          <sec id="Sec2">
            <title>1.1 Introduction</title>
            <p>In a study by the European Chemical Bureau (ECB), it was estimated that the new EU chemical legislation REACH would require 3.9 million additional test animals, if no alternative methods were accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The same study showed that it was possible to reduce the number of test animals significantly by utilizing existing experimental data in conjunction with (Quantitative) Structure Activity Relationship ((Q)SAR) models. Chronic and reproductive toxicity, <italic>in vivo</italic> mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are the endpoints that will require the largest number of test animals within REACH, because no alternative <italic>in vitro</italic> assays are available yet.</p>
            <p>Recent developments allow a more accurate prediction of complex toxicological endpoints than a few years ago. This progress has been supported by (i) the development of improved (Q)SAR algorithms, (ii) the availability of larger and better curated public databases, (iii) progress in computational chemistry and biology, and (iv) the development of an array of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays probing targets, pathways and endpoints.</p>
            <p>The routine application of these new generation models is however still rare, because</p>
            <p>â¢ Toxicity data has been collected in a variety of different databases;</p>
            <p>â¢ These databases use different formats, that are frequently not generally compatible with <italic>in silico</italic> programs;</p>
            <p>â¢ Many toxicity databases lack important information for modelling (e.g. curated chemical structures; inability to select and combine data from multiple sources);</p>
            <p>â¢ It is hard to integrate confidential in-house data with public data for model building and validation;</p>
            <p>â¢ Models have been published in a variety of different formats (ranging from simple regression based equations to full-fledged computer applications);</p>
            <p>â¢ There is no straightforward integration of predictions from various applications;</p>
            <p>â¢ There is no commonly accepted framework for the validation of <italic>in silico</italic> predictions and many <italic>in silico</italic> tools provide limited support for reliable validation procedures;</p>
            <p>â¢ The application, interpretation, and development of (Q)SAR models is still difficult for most toxicological experts. It requires a considerable amount of statistical, cheminformatics and computer science expertise and the procedures are labour-intensive and prone to human errors.</p>
            <p>The EC-funded FP7 project "OpenTox" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] aims to address these issues. The overall objective of OpenTox is to develop a framework that provides a unified access to <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity data, <italic>in silico</italic> models, procedures supporting validation and additional information that helps with the interpretation of predictions. OpenTox is accessible at three levels:</p>
            <p>â¢ A simplified user interface for toxicological experts that provides unified access to predictions, toxicological data, models and supporting information;</p>
            <p>â¢ A modelling expert interface for the streamlined development and validation of new models;</p>
            <p>â¢ Public OpenTox Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for the development, integration and validation of new algorithms and models.</p>
            <p>The core components of the OpenTox Framework are being developed or integrated with an open source licensing approach to optimize the dissemination and impact of the platform, to allow the inspection and review of algorithms, and to be open to potential contributions of value from the scientific community.</p>

            <title>1.2 OpenTox Objectives</title>
            <p>The overall long-term goal of OpenTox is the development of an interoperable, extensible predictive toxicology framework containing a collection of state-of-the art (Q)SAR, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, statistical and data mining tools, computational chemistry and biology algorithms and models, integratable <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data resources, ontologies and user-friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). OpenTox supports toxicological experts without specialist <italic>in silico</italic> expertise as well as model and algorithm developers. It moves beyond existing attempts to create individual research resources and tools, by providing a flexible and extensible framework that integrates existing solutions and new developments.</p>

            <title>1.3 OpenTox Design Principles</title>
            <p>The design principles of interoperability, flexibility, transparency and extensibility are key ingredients of the OpenTox Framework design, which additionally guide its architecture and implementation.</p>
            <sec id="Sec5">
              <title>1.3.1 Interoperability</title>
              <p>Interoperability with respect to the OpenTox Framework refers to the principle that different OpenTox components or services may correctly exchange information with each other and subsequently make use of that information. Both syntactic interoperability for correct data exchange and semantic interoperability supporting the accurate communication of meaning and interpretation of data are supported principles for OpenTox resources. The principles are reflected design-wise in the use of open, standardised interfaces and ontologies. The principles are relevant in application development and deployment when a combination of distributed multiple services can provide value to a user in completing a use case satisfactorily.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="Sec6">
              <title>1.3.2 Flexibility</title>
              <p>As a significant variety of user scenarios, requirements and use cases in predictive toxicology exist, flexibility is a key principle incorporated into OpenTox. Through the use of a component-based approach and the incorporation of the interoperability principles, many different and customised applications can be assembled that are based on the underlying platform.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="Sec7">
              <title>1.3.3 Transparency</title>
              <p>To achieve the scientific objective of knowledge-based enquiry based on principles of reasoning, reproducibility, and reliability, OpenTox supports the principle of transparency in its design. Computational models should be available for scrutiny by other scientists in as complete a manner and detail as possible. Evaluators and regulators should be able to both understand the details and accurately reproduce the results of predictive toxicity models, and be able to reliably form judgements on their validity as evidence. The principle also supports achievement of the OECD validation principles such as an unambiguous algorithm and a mechanistic interpretation, if possible. Use of Open Source, Open Interfaces and Standards within OpenTox support implementation of the transparency principle applied to <italic>in silico</italic>-based predictive toxicology applications and their reported results.</p>

            <sec id="Sec8">
              <title>1.3.4 Extensibility</title>
              <p>The field of predictive toxicology is rapidly developing and broadening in many areas including the use of biomarkers, systems biology, epigenetics, toxicokinetics, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, stem cell technology, and computational chemistry and biology. Hence, OpenTox needs to be extensible to a broad range of future predictive toxicology applications. In such applications, contributing and diverse experimental data and models need to be combined as evidence supporting integrated testing, safety and risk assessment and regulatory reporting as stipulated under REACH. In the initial design of the OpenTox Framework we have first attempted to create a general solution for (Q)SAR model development and application. We also will address and strengthen its extensibility in subsequent extensions of the OpenTox APIs, and guided by suitable use cases, to additional areas of scientific enquiry in the predictive toxicology field as part of its evolutionary development.</p>

          <sec id="Sec9">
            <title>1.4 Toxicity Data</title>
            <p>Toxicity data has been traditionally dispersed over a variety of databases where only a small fraction was immediately suitable for <italic>in silico</italic> modelling and structure-based searches because they contained chemical structures and defined toxicological endpoints. Recent efforts (e.g. from Istituto Superiore di SanitÃ  (ISS), Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology &amp; Experimental Medicine (FhG ITEM), US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), US Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA)) have improved the situation, because they provide curated data that has been compiled from various sources (public testing programs, general literature, non-confidential in-house data). Public repositories of bioassay data like PubChem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] provide additional information that can be used for toxicological risk assessment.</p>
            <p>The aggregation of data from different sources is however still far from trivial and poses some interesting toxicological, computer science, technological and legal questions, e.g.:</p>
            <p>â¢ Reliable identification of database entries that point to identical primary experiments;</p>
            <p>â¢ Reliable mapping from various non-unique chemical identifiers (e.g. names, CAS numbers) to chemical structures;</p>
            <p>â¢ Development of ontologies that describe the relationships between the various toxicological effects and mechanisms and related chemical and biological entities;</p>
            <p>â¢ Utilization of high content and high throughput screening data for toxicity predictions;</p>
            <p>â¢ Integration of databases with different access policies (and legal status);</p>
            <p>â¢ Structure anonymisation to share toxicity data from sensitive in-house datasets (if possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]);</p>
            <p>â¢ Systematic data quality assessment.</p>
            <p>As the size of toxicity databases prohibits a manual inspection of all data, it is necessary to apply advanced data- and text-mining techniques to solve most of these tasks automatically and to identify instances that need human inspection.</p>
            <p>Some of the data integration issues have already been addressed by other computational toxicology and chemistry initiatives e.g. ECB QSAR Model Reporting Format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], DSSTox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], ToxML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], CDK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], InChI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However although these approaches solve some technical aspects of data integration, none of them provides an architecture for the seamless merging and use of toxicity data from various sources. An OpenTox goal is to provide unified access to existing tools for data integration, develop new tools for this purpose, provide sound validation techniques and aid driving efforts to develop standards in this area.</p>

          <sec id="Sec10">
            <title>1.5 Ontologies</title>
            <p>The definition of ontology and controlled vocabulary in OpenTox is required so as to standardize and organize high-level concepts, chemical information and toxicological data. Distributed OpenTox services exchanging communications need to have unambiguous interpretations of the meaning of any terminology and data that they exchange between each other.</p>
            <p>Prioritisation of OpenTox toxicological endpoints focuses on those endpoints recognized internationally as critical for the testing of chemicals. Primary sources of information include the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the toxicological endpoints relevant to the assessment of chemicals in the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>

            <title>1.6 Approach to Predictive Toxicology (Q)SARs</title>
            <p>Initial OpenTox work has focused on creating a Framework for the support of (Q)SAR-based data driven approaches.</p>
            <sec id="Sec12">
              <title>1.6.1 Toxicity (Q)SARs</title>
              <p>Because of its relevance for the reduction of animal testing, we are focusing initially on the reproductive toxicity, chronic toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity endpoints. The OpenTox Framework however works independently of the underlying data, which makes it useful also for any other toxicology-relevant endpoints.</p>
              <p>The main problem for toxicological modellers is that they have to deal with endpoints with very complex and frequently unknown biological mechanisms and with datasets with very diverse structures. This currently prohibits in many cases a systems biology approach as well as the application of simple regression-based techniques. For this reason advanced data mining and cheminformatics techniques are gaining increasing acceptance within the toxicological community. Modern techniques like lazar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], fminer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and iSAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] allow the automated determination of relevant chemical descriptors and the generation of prediction models that are understandable and interpretable by non-computer scientists.</p>
              <p>Many (Q)SAR models for the prediction of mutagenic and carcinogenic properties have been developed in recent years. The prediction of bacterial mutagenicity is relatively successful (typical accuracies 80%), but the success with carcinogenicity predictions has been much more limited and very few models are available for <italic>in vivo</italic> mutagenicity. With recent developments like lazar, it is however possible to predict rodent carcinogenicity with accuracies similar to bacterial mutagenicity and to achieve a reliable estimation of prediction confidences. It is likely that further improvements can be obtained with better algorithms for chemical and biological feature generation, feature selection and model generation, and the novel combination of existing techniques.</p>

            <sec id="Sec13">
              <title>1.6.2 Aggregation of Predictions from various Models</title>
              <p>It is known from machine learning, that the aggregation of different prediction models leads to increased accuracies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The aggregation of predictions from different <italic>in silico</italic> programs is however still a cumbersome task that requires a lot of human intervention and <italic>ad hoc</italic> solutions. A new plugin-architecture is therefore needed that allows an easy integration of models and programs from different origins, independently of their programming language and legal status. Similar plugin facilities are needed for algorithms that perform a dedicated task during model generation (e.g. feature generation, feature selection, classification, regression). With such a modularized approach it will be easier to experiment with new algorithms and new combinations of algorithms and to compare the results with benchmarked methods.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="Sec14">
              <title>1.6.3 Validation of Models</title>
              <p>An objective validation framework is crucial for the acceptance and the development of <italic>in silico</italic> models. The risk assessor needs reliable validation results to assess the quality of predictions; model developers need this information to (i) avoid the overfitting of models, (ii) to compare new models with benchmarked techniques and (iii) to get ideas for the improvement of algorithms (e.g. from the inspection of misclassified instances). Validation results can also be useful for data providers as misclassifications point frequently to flawed database entries. OpenTox is actively supporting the OECD Principles for (Q)SAR Validation so as to provide easy-to-use validation tools for algorithm and model developers.</p>
              <p>Care must be taken, that no information from test sets leaks into the training set, either performing certain steps (frequently supervised feature generation or selection) for the complete dataset or by "optimizing" parameters until the resulting model fits a particular test set by chance. For this reason OpenTox provides standardized validation routines within the framework that can be applied to all prediction algorithms that are plugged into the system. These kinds of techniques are standard in the field of machine learning and data-mining, but are however not yet consistently employed within the field of (Q)SAR modelling.</p>

              <title>1.6.4 Determination of Applicability Domains</title>
              <p>For practical purposes it is important to know the proportion of compounds that fall within the Applicability Domain (AD) of a certain model. For this purpose OpenTox will provide automated facilities to identify the proportion of reliable predictions for the "chemical universe" e.g. structures of the database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], particular subsets (e.g. certain classes of pharmaceuticals, food additives, REACH submission compounds) and for in-house databases. This feature will also help with a more reliable estimation of the potential to reduce animal experiments.</p>

            <sec id="Sec16">
              <title>1.6.5 Retrieval of supporting Information</title>
              <p>Linking (Q)SAR predictions to external data sources has found little attention in the (Q)SAR community. It is however essential for the critical evaluation of predictions and for the understanding of toxicological mechanisms. Again the problem is less trivial as it seems at a first glance and requires similar techniques as those for database aggregation. The development of new text mining techniques is crucial for the retrieval of factual information from publications.</p>

            <sec id="Sec17">
              <title>1.6.6 Interfaces</title>
              <p>Model developers will benefit from a set of APIs that allow an easy integration, testing and validation of new algorithms. New techniques can be easily tested with relevant real-world toxicity data and compared to the performance of benchmark algorithms.</p>

              <title>1.6.7 Toxicity databases</title>
              <p>OpenTox database work aims to integrate and provide high-quality toxicity data for predictive toxicology model development and validation. OpenTox supports the creation of dictionaries and ontologies that describe the relations between chemical and toxicological data and experiments and for the retrieval and quality assurance of toxicological information. This includes tools for chemical syntax checking, structure consolidation, and the identification of inconsistent data that requires manual inspection.</p>

              <title>1.6.8 (Q)SAR algorithms</title>
              <p>OpenTox provides access to (Q)SAR algorithms that derive data-based predictions and models. Predictions are visualized by an application GUI or serve as input for validation routines. The open architecture is designed to allow an easy integration of external programs (open source and closed source) into any specific application.</p>
              <p>OpenTox is starting with the integration of cheminformatics, statistical and data mining tools including functionality from other open source projects (e.g. R, WEKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Taverna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], CDK, OpenBabel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). A flexible plug-in architecture for applying, testing and validating algorithms interactively and systematically is used. OpenTox algorithms offer support for common tasks, such as feature generation and selection, aggregation, and visualization. The open source plug-in architecture should encourage researchers from other areas (e.g., data mining or machine learning) to integrate their methods in a safe testing environment with relevant datasets. OpenTox currently implements:</p>
              <p>1. Algorithms for the generation and selection of features for the representation of chemicals (structure-based features, chemical and biological properties);</p>
              <p>2. Classification and regression algorithms for the creation of (Q)SAR models;</p>
              <p>3. Services for the combination of predictions from multiple algorithms and endpoints; and</p>
              <p>4. General purpose algorithms (e.g. for the determination of chemical similarities, estimation of applicability domains, categorization, read across and sub-structure based database queries).</p>

              <p>OpenTox pursues a use case driven development and testing approach. Use case development involves input from both users and developers, an internal and external peer review process, and testing approach based on user evaluation of the applications developed for the use case. Once use cases are reviewed and accepted, they are published publically on the OpenTox website.</p>
              <p>OpenTox use cases are classified hierarchically into three classes:</p>
              <p>Class 1: Collaboration/Project Level (e.g., 3 month development project);</p>
              <p>Class 2: Application Level, e.g., carry out a REACH-compliant risk assessment for a group of chemicals;</p>

            <title>2.2 The OpenTox Framework Design</title>
            <p>OpenTox is a platform-independent collection of components that interact via well-defined interfaces. The preferred form of communication between components is through web services. A set of minimum required functionalities for OpenTox components of various categories (prediction, descriptor calculation, data access, validation, report generation) are available on the OpenTox website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
            <p>OpenTox tries to follow the best practices of open source project management for core framework components. This means that source code, technical discussions and documents are open to the general public and interested parties can participate in development if they have registered for access to the developers' area of the website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
            <p>OpenTox is committed to the support and further development of Open Standards and Ontologies. Appendix 1 summarises some of the most important standards of relevance to the Framework.</p>
            <sec id="Sec24">
              <title>2.2.1 Architecture</title>
              <p>OpenTox is a framework for the integration of algorithms for predicting chemical toxicity and provides:</p>
              <p>â¢ components for specialized tasks (e.g. database lookups, descriptor calculation, classification, regression, report generation) that communicate through well-defined language independent interfaces;</p>
              <p>â¢ applications that implement the capabilities of OpenTox components for specific Use Cases.</p>
              <p>The OpenTox Framework supports building multiple applications, as well as providing components for third party applications. The Framework guarantees the portability of components by enforcing language-independent interfaces. Implementation of an integration component in a specific language/platform automatically ports the entire OpenTox Framework to that language/platform.</p>
              <p>The OpenTox Framework is composed of:</p>
              <p>â¢ Components - every component encapsulates a set of functionalities and exposes them via well defined language-independent interfaces (protocols);</p>
              <p>â¢ Data Infrastructure adhering to interoperable principles and standards;</p>
              <p>â¢ Ontologies and associated services;</p>
              <p>â¢ Documentation and guidance for application development and use.</p>
              <p>An OpenTox-based application implements a specific Use Case, with the appropriate user interfaces, and adhering to guidance on APIs and standards.</p>

              <p>OpenTox components are described by templates providing documentation including minimum requirements and dependency tracking on the OpenTox website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The current (Q)SAR-related component categories include Prediction, Descriptor Calculation, Data Access, Report Generation, Validation and Integration. Initial components include Rumble, Toxmatch, Toxtree, iSar, lazar, AMBIT, FreeTreeMiner, LibFminer, gSpan', MakeMNA, MakeQNA, and MakeSCR.</p>
              <p>The interactions between components are determined by their intended use and can differ across different Use Cases, which consist of a series of steps, each applying component functionalities on input data. The interaction between components is implemented as a component. Interaction components such as workflows (e.g., Taverna) combine multiple services to offer the following functionalities:</p>
              <p>â¢ load the series of steps, corresponding to the specific Use Case (from a configuration file on a file system or on a network);</p>

              <title>2.2.3 OpenTox Application Programming Interfaces</title>
              <p>To assure reliable interoperability between the various OpenTox web services, a well-defined API is required. The OpenTox APIs specify how each OpenTox web service can be used, and how the returned resources look like. It further specifies the HTML status codes returned in case of succeeded operations as well as errors codes. OpenTox interfaces have the minimum required functionalities shown in Appendix 2. The initial specifications for the OpenTox APIs have been defined and are available on the OpenTox website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The initial objects already specified are Endpoint, Structure, Structure Identifiers, Feature Definition, Feature, Feature Service, Reference, Algorithm, Algorithm Type, Model, Dataset, Validation Result, Applicability Domain, Feature Selection, and Reporting.</p>
              <p>All current OpenTox web services adhere to the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) web service architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] for sharing data and functionality among loosely-coupled, distributed heterogeneous systems.</p>
              <p><italic>Further information on interfaces and the REST approach is included in</italic> Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>.</p>
              <p>The choice of employing web services allows the complete framework to operate in different locations, independent of operating systems and underlying implementation details.</p>
              <p>Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the OpenTox resources modelled in the OpenTox Ontology. These resources are provided by the various OpenTox web services. The links between the components reflects interaction between the respective web services.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Relationships between OpenTox Resources modelled in the OpenTox Ontology</bold>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13321_2010_Article_29_Fig2_HTML.jpg" /></fig></p>
              <p>The model web service provides access to (prediction) models. Models are created via the algorithm web service, which supports different types of algorithms (e.g. supervised learning, feature selection, descriptor calculation, and data cleanup). Building a model will normally require various parameters, one or several datasets, as well as a set of features.</p>
              <p>Datasets are stored in the dataset web service. A dataset contains data entries, which are chemical compounds, as well as their feature values. Features are defined as objects representing a property of a compound, including descriptors and calculated features, endpoints, and predictions. Different representations for chemical compounds can be accessed from the compound web service. The feature web service provides the available features (e.g. structural features, chemical descriptors, endpoints).</p>
              <p>The validation web service evaluates and compares the performance of prediction models. Simple training-test-set-validation is supported as well as cross-validation. The validation result contains quality statistical figures and reports (available in html or pdf formats) that visualize the validation results. The task web service supports long-running, asynchronous processes. The ontology web service provides meta information from relevant ontologies (which can be accessed using SPARQL queries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]), as well as lists of available services. Approaches to Authentication and Authorization will be specified in the next version 1.2 of the API.</p>
              <p>All OpenTox resources have representations providing information about the type of resource, and what the service accepts as input such as tuning parameters. Most algorithms and model resources in OpenTox are available in multiple representations. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and in particular its XML formatted variant, was chosen as the master data exchange format, due to the following reasons:</p>

              </p>
              <p>Some services support additional representations like JavaScript Object Notation JSON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], YAML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or Application/X-Turtle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Some prediction model services provide Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) representations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to improve their portability, since many machine learning applications like Weka provide support for PMML. The second version of the API, OpenTox API version 1.1, was completed and published on the OpenTox website in November 2009. Version 1.2 is scheduled for completion for September 2010 and is open to community-based input and comments on the OpenTox API pages containing more detailed information on the interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>

            <p>The definition of ontology and controlled vocabulary is extremely important to the construction of the OpenTox data infrastructure. It contributes to the necessary standardization and rational organization of data, thus facilitating both vertical (e.g., within one toxicological endpoint) and horizontal (e.g., through different endpoints) retrievals. The definition consists of two main steps: first, the selection of the toxicological endpoints to be included; second, the definition of the type and extent of information for each endpoint, and their internal relationships and hierarchies.</p>

              <title>2.3.1 Schema</title>
              <p>Two publicly available schemas for describing toxicology data are the OECD harmonised templates (OECD-HTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and the ToxML (Toxicology XML standard) schema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It appears that the OECD-HTs have the advantage of being closer to the schemas established by the regulators for the industry to submit their data. However, this schema is quite generic, and does not lend easily itself to the needs of the OpenTox project in terms of scientific databases and scientific computing. On the other hand, the ToxML schema has many features necessary for accommodating large amounts of data at different levels of complexity, and for creating hierarchies within ontology constructs.</p>

              <p>The OpenTox data infrastructure prioritises support of toxicological end points for which data are required under the REACH regulation. In current toxicological testing, these endpoints are addressed by both <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal experiments carried out according to OECD guidelines.</p>
              <p>The toxicological endpoints considered by REACH are the following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]: Skin irritation, Skin corrosion; Eye irritation; Dermal sensitisation; Mutagenicity; Acute oral toxicity; Acute inhalative toxicity; Acute dermal toxicity; Repeated dose toxicity (28 days); Repeated dose toxicity (90 days); Reproductive toxicity screening; Developmental toxicity; Two-generation reproductive toxicity study; Toxicokinetics; and Carcinogenicity study.</p>
              <p>The OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] are published on the Internet. Whereas there is no official list of OECD endpoints (test guidelines are developed according to the needs of member countries), and no official OECD approach to toxicity testing, interesting background information on criteria for toxicity testing has been developed as SIDS (Screening Information Data Set) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>

              <p>The main source of data for the public OpenTox data infrastructure is in the public domain, which is spread in many and varied sources and databases. They can be categorized into:</p>
              <p>- Textual databases (e.g., IARC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], NTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]);</p>
              <p>- Machine readable files (e.g., .sdf) that include both structures and data, and that can be immediately used by modellers for (Q)SAR analyses in the OpenTox platform (e.g., DSSTox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], ISSCAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], AMBIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], RepDose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]);</p>
              <p>- Large and quite complex databases on the Internet (e.g., PubChem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], ACToR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]).</p>
              <p>The above differences in the types of data sources are entwined with differences in the quality of data (some databases may contain contradictory results, with no critical selection), and with changes with time (updates). Because of the varying data quality level of the various data sources, higher priority is given to databases subject to curation and quality evaluation. Databases being integrated in the first phase of OpenTox development include ISSCAN, DSSTox, CPDBAS, DBPCAN, EPAFHM, KIERBL, IRISTR, FDAMDD, ECETOC skin irritation, LLNA skin sensitisation and the Bioconcentration factor (BCF) Gold Standard Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

              <p>The OpenTox data infrastructure on toxicological data is used to support the development of (Q)SAR models within the OpenTox platform. Thus, its design takes into account the requirements of (Q)SAR modelling. A wide spectrum of (Q)SAR approaches, as applied to toxicity, exists today, ranging from coarse-grained to fine-tuned ones. Broad classes are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]:</p>
              <p>- structural alerts, which are substructures and reactive groups linked to the induction of chemical toxicity (e.g., carcinogenicity). They are used for preliminary hazard characterization, are quite popular with regulators and industry, and most often are based on, and provide to the users mechanistic information;</p>
              <p>- QSARs for noncongeneric sets of chemicals (e.g., lazar, PASS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]), which generate probabilities of being active/inactive (and to what extent) for compounds with very different structures;</p>
              <p>- QSARs for congeneric sets of chemicals (e.g., Hansch approach), which use mechanistically-based descriptors, and describe how relatively small changes in structure can provoke variations in activity. Series of very similar (highly congeneric) chemicals are usually developed by industry.</p>
              <p>Despite their differences, all the various (Q)SAR modelling approaches share the need of a highly structured information as a starting point. This includes the selection of ontologies, with controlled vocabulary and hierarchies.</p>
              <p>We believe that such ontology work should be part of a public global community resource, subject to review and curation. We have created OpenToxipedia as a collaborative resource for the entry and editing of toxicology terms, supported by a Semantic Media Wiki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. An OpenTox Ontology Working Group is dedicated to the development and incorporation of ontologies which are relevant to OpenTox Use Cases; collaborative work on projects is supported by a Collaborative ProtÃ©gÃ© Editor. The approach is also to work with other groups with existing ontology developments so as to maximise reuse and interoperability between public ontologies.</p>

For each algorithm a short text description and a uniform (for each of the three categories) table was generated to facilitate a comparison with respect to the selection criteria. The text description of the algorithm gives a brief overview of the algorithm's background, its capabilities, dependencies and technical features. The uniform tables have three logical parts. The first one enables a black-box point of view of the algorithm and has the same fields for every algorithm category. It contains a field for the name, the input and output (semantically), the input and output format, user-specific parameters and reporting information. The second logical part is variable for the three algorithm categories and describes some intrinsic properties of the algorithms. It comprises fields for the algorithm's background and its performance. The descriptor calculation algorithms have a special field for the type of descriptor that is generated. The classification and regression algorithms have additional fields for the applicability domain and the confidence in the prediction, the bias, the type of learning (lazy or eager learning) and the interpretability of the generated model. The feature selection algorithms have special fields for type of feature selection (class-blind or class-sensitive), for the distinction of optimal, greedy or randomized methods and for the distinction of filter and wrapper approaches. The third part of the description table is again identical for the different algorithm categories. It gives information about the algorithm's availability within OpenTox, the license and dependencies, the convenience of integration, the priority of integration, the author of the algorithm and the author of the description. Additionally there are fields for a contact address (email) and for comments.

              <sec id="Sec37">
                <title>PRINCIPLE 1: "DEFINED ENDPOINT"</title>
                <p>OpenTox addresses this principle by providing a unified source of well-defined and documented toxicity data. (Q)SAR model quality crucially depends on the clarity of endpoints and experimental protocols used and the ability to communicate this information in an unambiguous way, both in model development and model application. The current practice usually includes a textual description of the materials and methods used for acquiring experimental data as well as literature references, while the model description is a separate entity. The challenge to the distributed web services framework, was to provide an automatic and unique way of describing and linking the endpoint information in a formal way, able to be processed automatically by the software, with minimal human interaction. This is currently solved by making use of a simple ontology of endpoints. We have defined an ontology based on the OWL (Web Ontology Language) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] for toxicological endpoints which is in line with current ECHA REACH guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Using this ontology, each attribute in a toxicological dataset can be associated with an entry to the ontology, therefore allowing a unique mapping between endpoints in various and heterogeneous datasets. This ontology possesses 5 subclasses: ecotoxic effects, environmental fate parameters, human health effects, physico-chemical effects, and toxicokinetics. Each of these subclasses has one or two further layers of subclasses.</p>

                <title>PRINCIPLE 2: "AN UNAMBIGUOUS ALGORITHM"</title>
                <p>OpenTox provides unified access to documented models and algorithms as well as to the source code of their implementation. Currently OpenTox is deploying Algorithm Template descriptions and an algorithm type ontology which allows a clear definition of what type of algorithm(s) is used to construct a model.</p>

              <sec id="Sec39">
                <title>PRINCIPLE 3: "DEFINED APPLICABILITY DOMAIN"</title>
                <p>OpenTox integrates tools for the determination of applicability domains (ADs) and the consideration of ADs during the validation of (Q)SAR models. Evaluation of ADs are supported by an OpenTox algorithm API supporting situations where the AD is calculated both for situations where it is included as part of the model building application and those where it is carried out separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A specific AD algorithm is applied to a dataset, and the result is then an AD model. This model can then be applied to reason about the applicability of a model when applied to a new compound query.</p>

                <title>PRINCIPLE 4: "APPROPRIATE MEASURES OF GOODNESS-OF-FIT, ROBUSTENESS AND PREDICTIVITY"</title>
                <p>OpenTox provides scientifically sound validation routines for the determination of these measures. Within the validation part of the prototype framework, we have concentrated so far on including validation and cross-validation objects. These include a set of measures for evaluating the quality of models generated by algorithms on the datasets as summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Measures for evaluating the Quality of OpenTox Models</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2"><p>Measures for Classification Tasks</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Name</p></td><td align="left"><p>Explanation</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Confusion Matrix</p></td><td align="left"><p>A confusion matrix is a matrix, where each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class, while each column represents the instances in an actual class.

                <title>PRINCIPLE 5: "A MECHANISTIC INTERPRETATION, IF POSSIBLE"</title>
                <p>As mechanistic interpretation often relies on human knowledge, this usually cannot be done automatically. However, in the current API it is foreseen to generate skeletons for reporting using the validation results created by extensive testing during model construction, allowing subsequent user-entered explanations about mechanisms. Other potential future extensions of OpenTox services could include resources providing insight on mechanisms, e.g. from pathways and systems biology models, selection and inclusion of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays relevant to the mechanism in the model, or from data mining of human adverse events data. QMRF reporting is being facilitated by the current integration of the existing QMRF editor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] into OpenTox, this allowing end-users to annotate models with the information required by the QMRF format.</p>

              <title>2.5.2 OpenTox Approach to Validation</title>
              <p>To guarantee a fair comparison to other algorithms, the following principles are followed:</p>
              <p>â¢ Separation of validation as an independent service to algorithm and model building services;</p>
              <p>â¢ Ability to reproduce the computational experiment (even in non-deterministic models e.g., by storing initial random values/random seeds);</p>
              <p>â¢ Retrieval of the exact same training and test data that was used, so that all algorithms have to work with the same data (store random seed for cross-validation);</p>
              <p>â¢ Use of an external validation comparison and test set that performs the same operations for all algorithms (and prevents unintended cheating).</p>
              <p>Validation testing results are stored for subsequent retrieval because this allows obtaining information about the performance of various algorithms/models (on particular datasets) without repeating (time-consuming) experiments. This is especially useful when developing new algorithms or new versions of algorithms to allow a quick comparison to other methods.</p>

              <title>2.5.4 Validation Application Example: Building and Validating a Model</title>
              <p>The application example of building and validating a model is executed using the Validation web service prototype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] (developed at the Albert Ludwigs Freiburg University (ALU-FR)) along with the lazar and fminer algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (provided by In Silico Toxicology (IST)). The application is compliant with the OpenTox API, and based on interoperability between two OpenTox web services, located at two different locations: ALU-FR's services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and the web services of IST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p>
              <p>The goal of this Use Case is to evaluate a prediction algorithm: the algorithm trains a model on a training dataset, and then predicts the compounds of a test dataset towards a certain toxicology endpoint. The validation result reflects how well the model performed. The workflow for the training test set validation is illustrated in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Web services are displayed as rectangles; the three key POST REST operations are symbolized as dashed lines, while solid lines visualize data flow operations.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Workflow diagram illustrating the training test set validation of a prediction algorithm</bold>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13321_2010_Article_29_Fig4_HTML.jpg" /></fig></p>

            <title>2.7 OpenTox Data Infrastructure</title>
            <p>A major pre-requisite for the successful implementation of the main principles of the Three Rs Declaration of Bologna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] is the universal access to high quality experimental data on various chemical properties. In particular, the range of replacement alternatives methods includes the following OpenTox-relevant approaches:</p>
            <p>
              <list list-type="bullet">
                <list-item>
                  <p>The improved storage, exchange and use of information from animal experiments already carried out, so that unnecessary repetition can be avoided;</p>

              </list>
            </p>
            <p>Since it is likely that, in many circumstances, an animal test cannot be currently replaced by a single replacement alternative method, the development, evaluation and optimisation of stepwise testing strategies and integrated testing schemes should be encouraged. The OpenTox data facilities, made publically accessible through a web services framework, provide a solid basis for addressing the above mentioned replacement alternative goals in a more efficient, technically sound and integrated way compared to current uncoordinated practices and fragmented resources. Unfortunately, even today, more than half a century after Russell and Burchs's original publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and more than 10 years after the adoption of the Three Rs Declaration of Bologna, the "state-of-the-art" is characterised by highly fragmented and unconnected life sciences data (both from a physical and ontological perspective), which is furthermore frequently inaccurate and/or difficult or even impossible to find or access. The OpenTox approach to data resource management and integration has the following major features, which address the replacement alternatives challenge and associated user, industry and regulatory needs including REACH:</p>

            <p>We describe here the implementation of two Use Cases as applications based on the OpenTox Framework. The first case, ToxPredict, is aimed at the user having no or little experience in QSAR predictions. This Use Case should offer an easy-to-use user interface, allowing the user to enter a chemical structure and to obtain in return a toxicity prediction for one or more endpoints. The second case, ToxCreate, is aimed at the experienced user, allowing them to construct and to validate models using a number of datasets and algorithms.</p>
            <p>Both Use Cases also demonstrate inter-connectivity between multiple OpenTox services. Within ToxPredict, web services from three different service providers (TUM, IDEA, and NTUA) are operating together. In ToxCreate the model construction is performed using IST web services, while the validation and reporting is executed using ALU-FR services.</p>

                <p>In the third step, a list of available models is displayed. Links to training datasets, algorithms and descriptor calculation REST services are provided. The models provide information about the independent variables used, the target variables (experimental toxicity data) and predicted values. All these variables are accessible via the OpenTox Feature web service, where each feature can be associated with a specific entry from the existing endpoint ontology. The association is usually done during the upload of the training data into the database. The endpoint, associated with the model variables is automatically retrieved and displayed in the first column of the list. This provides an automatic and consistent way of complying with the first OECD validation principle of using a "Defined endpoint".</p>
                <p>This step involves an interplay between multiple OpenTox web services. Algorithm, Model, and Feature services are registered into the Ontology service, which provides RDF triple storage with SPARQL, allowing various queries. The ToxPredict application queries the Ontology service for all available models, along with the associated information about algorithms used in the model, descriptors, and endpoints. The list of models may include models, provided by different partners and running on several remote sites (TUM and IDEA models are shown in this example). The Ontology service serves like a hub for gathering a list of available models and algorithms from remote sites. There could be multiple instances of the ToxPredict application, configured to use different Ontology services, and therefore, allowing for a different subset of models to be exposed to end users.</p>

                <title>ToxPredict Step 4 - Perform the estimation</title>
                <p>Models, selected in Step 3 are launched in Step 4, where the user can monitor the status of the processing. The processing status is retrieved via OpenTox Task services. Different Model, Algorithm, Dataset, and Ontology services, running on different remote locations can be involved at this stage. If a model relies on a set of descriptors, an automatic calculation procedure is performed, which involves launching a descriptor calculation by remote Algorithm services. The procedure is as follows:</p>
                <p>The Ontology service is queried to retrieve information about the independent variables, used in the model. If no such variables are involved (e.g., in case of ToxTree models, which rely on chemical structure only), the workflow proceeds towards model estimation. In case of a model, based on descriptors (e.g., a regression model), the procedure is slightly more complex, as explained below.</p>
                <p>Each independent variable is represented as a Feature and managed via the Feature service. Each feature has associated a web address (OWL property opentox:hasSource from OpenTox OWL ontology), which specifies its origin. The tag could point to an OpenTox Algorithm or Model service, in case it holds a calculated value, or point to a Dataset service, in case it contains information, uploaded as a dataset (for example experimental endpoint data). If the feature origin is a descriptor calculation algorithm, the web address points to the Algorithm service, used to calculate descriptor values, and the same web address can be used again via the OpenTox Algorithm API in order to calculate descriptors for user-specified structures. The Algorithm services perform the calculation and store results into a Dataset service, possibly at a remote location. Then finally, a dataset with all calculated descriptor values is submitted to the Model service. Upon estimation, Model results are submitted to a Dataset service, which could be at a remote location, which could be the same or different to that for the model services.</p>
                <p>The interplay of multiple services, running on remote sites, provide a flexible means for the integration of models and descriptors, developed by different organisations and running in different environments. Identification of algorithms and models via web URIs ensure the compliance with the OECD validation principle 2 of "An unambiguous algorithm", as well as repeatability of the results of the model building. Extensive meta information about the algorithm and models themselves is accessible via web URIs and the OpenTox API.</p>

                <p>The final step displays estimation results (see Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), as well as compound identification and other related data. Initial demonstration reports in several formats can be accessed via icons on the right hand side of the browser display.</p>
                <p>ToxPredict is a demonstration web application, providing a user-friendly interface for estimating toxicological hazards. It provides a front end to multiple OpenTox services, currently integrating IDEA ontology, dataset, feature and model services with TUM descriptor calculation and model services and NTUA algorithm services. Future work will include integration of other third party model services, as well as Validation and Reporting services. While current functionality may appear to an end-user not much different from a stand-alone prediction application like ToxTree, the back-end technology provides a very flexible means for integrating datasets, models and algorithms, developed by different software technologies and organisations and running at remote locations.</p>

              <title>2.8.2 ToxCreate application</title>
              <p>The ToxCreate Use Case, in contrast to ToxPredict, is aimed at researchers working in the life sciences and toxicology, QSAR experts, and industry and government groups supporting risk assessment, who are interested in building predictive toxicology models. It allows the creation of a number of models using one or more algorithms. Therefore it is not as easy to use as the ToxPredict application, as not only the algorithm has to be selected, but also the right parameter setting needs to be explored; these parameters are algorithm-dependent. For this decision-making, the expert has to have sound knowledge of the algorithm they are using.</p>
              <p>The following sequence of steps explains the execution of a sample session of the ToxCreate application:</p>

                <title>ToxCreate Step 1 - Upload Dataset</title>
                <p>The first step of the ToxCreate workflow enables the user to specify a model training dataset in CSV format, consisting of chemical structures (SMILES) with binary class labels (e.g. active/inactive). The file is uploaded to the server and labelled with a user-defined name. In contrast to ToxPredict, users can specify their own training data/endpoint. This is done in batch mode, i.e. without interactive screens to select chemicals based on different criteria, which is convenient for expert users. By hitting "Create model", a QSAR model is derived. The current prototype demonstrates lazar models only. No model parameters can be set at this time, but future versions will enable arbitrary OpenTox API-compliant models.</p>

It features status information, date and number of compounds present in the dataset. A link leads to the complete specification of the model in OWL-DL. Through integration with the OpenTox Validation service, it is possible to validate the model and select the most appropriate models for further evaluation. At this point, the model is permanently stored on the server and can be used for predictions at any time in the future.</p>

Together with model validation, users are able to use ToxCreate to select appropriate models with adjusted parameters beforehand. By predicting a variety of related endpoints, instead of just one, combined with arbitrary models at the same time, ToxCreate enables free predictive toxicology modelling exploration along different dimensions.</p>

          <title>3. Discussion</title>
          <p>The OpenTox Framework supports the development of <italic>in silico</italic> predictive toxicology applications based on OpenTox components for data management, algorithms and validation. Initial applications are being provided openly to users and developers through the OpenTox website and linked services including partner resources. Such applications support users in the development and training of QSAR models against their own toxicological datasets, e.g., they may upload a dataset for a given endpoint to an OpenTox service, define a variety of parameters and build and download a model. Subsequent releases in 2010 and 2011 will extend the Framework to the support of a broader range of computational chemistry and biology modelling approaches, and integration of data from new <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, and refine the API designs based on development experiences on the effectiveness of applications in supporting integrated testing strategies as required by REACH.</p>
          <p>OpenTox provides a platform technology with:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>a unified interface to access toxicity data and <italic>in silico</italic> models;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a framework for the development and validation of new (Q)SAR models;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a framework for the development, validation and implementation of new <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>well defined standards for the exchange of data, knowledge, models and algorithms.</p></list-item></list></p>
          <p>OpenTox currently provides high-quality data and robust (Q)SAR models to explore the chronic, reproductive, carcinogenic and genotoxic toxicity of chemicals. The integration of further toxicological endpoints should be straightforward with OpenTox tools and standards.</p>
          <p>OpenTox is tailored especially to meet the requirements of the REACH legislation and to contribute to the reduction of animal experiments for toxicity testing. It adheres and supports the <italic>OECD Guidelines for (Q)SAR Validation</italic> and incorporates the <italic>QSAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF)</italic> from the EC Joint Research Council (EC JRC). Relevant international authorities (e.g., EC JRC, ECVAM, EPA, FDA) and industry organisations participate actively in the advisory board of the OpenTox project and provide input for the continuing development of requirement definitions and standards for data, knowledge and model exchange.</p>
          <p>OpenTox will actively support the further development and validation of <italic>in silico</italic> models and algorithms by improving the interoperability between individual systems (common standards for data and model exchange), increasing the reproducibility of <italic>in silico</italic> models (by providing a common source of structures, toxicity data and algorithms) and by providing scientifically-sound and easy-to-use validation routines. For this reason it is likely that the predictive toxicology application development cycle will speed up which will lead to improved and more reliable results. As OpenTox offers all of these features openly to developers and researchers, we expect an international impact that goes beyond a single research project. For organisations, that cannot afford a dedicated computational toxicology department, the OpenTox community provides an alternative affordable source of solutions and expertise.</p>
          <p>Biotech and pharmaceutical industry SMEs will benefit from the OpenTox project, because it will provide access to toxicological information and <italic>in silico</italic> models from a single, easy-to-use interface that is publicly available. OpenTox should reduce the costs for product candidate development by providing new resources for toxicity screening at a very early stage of product development, thus eliminating toxic liabilities early and reducing the number of expensive (and sometimes animal consuming) efficacy and toxicity experiments. With the OpenTox Framework it will also be possible to identify substructures that are responsible for toxicity (or detoxification), and information that can be used for the design of safer and more efficient products.</p>
          <p>The ECB estimated that 3.9 million additional animals could potentially be used for the initial implementation of the REACH program (A more recent evaluation based on REACH chemical pre-registrations at ECHA indicate an even larger testing requirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]). Chronic effects such as reproductive and developmental toxicity, <italic>in vivo</italic> mutagenicity and carcinogenicity will require ~72% of the test animals (~2.8 million animals). In the same study a 1/3 - 1/2 reduction potential was estimated for (Q)SAR techniques available at that time (2003). As OpenTox focuses initially on the development of improved (Q)SAR techniques for reproductive, developmental and repeated dose toxicity, and for <italic>in vivo</italic> mutagenicity and carcinogenicity endpoints, it could contribute substantially to an estimated reduction potential of 1.4 million animals alone for REACH. A more detailed analysis of replacement possibilities under consideration of applicability domains is being currently pursued.</p>
          <p>The OpenTox Framework works independently of the toxicity endpoint. As it will be easy to plug in databases for other endpoints, it is likely that significant savings will occur also for other endpoints (e.g. ecotoxicity endpoints from the FP7 Environment Theme ENV.2007.3.3.1.1). An exciting opportunity in this respect is the inclusion of human data from epidemiological and clinical studies and the utilization of data from adverse effect reporting systems, because in this case no data from animal experiments will be needed.</p>

          <title>4. Conclusions</title>
          <p>This work provides a perspective on the growing significance of collaborative approaches in predictive toxicology to create the OpenTox Framework as a public standards-based interoperable platform. Key challenges to be overcome are both technical and cultural and involve progressing issues related to cross-organisational, enterprise and application interoperability, knowledge management and developing a culture and framework supporting a community-based platform and collaborative projects emerging from the community foundation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The OpenTox Framework offers a standardized interface to state-of-the art predictive toxicology algorithms, models, datasets, validation and reporting facilities on the basis of RESTful web services and guided by the OECD Principles, REACH legislation and user requirements.</p>
          <p>Initial OpenTox research has provided tools for the integration of data, for the generation and validation of (Q)SAR models for toxic effects, libraries for the development and integration of (Q)SAR algorithms, and scientifically-sound validation routines. OpenTox supports the development of applications for non-computational specialists in addition to interfaces for risk assessors, toxicological experts and model and algorithm developers.</p>
          <p>The OpenTox prototype established a distributed state-of-the-art data warehousing for predictive toxicology. It enables improved storage, exchange, aggregation, quality labelling, curation and integrated use of high quality life sciences information, and allows for consistent and scientifically sound mathematical and computer modelling, including modelling of structure-activity relationships for REACH-relevant endpoints.</p>
          <p>A key decision towards algorithm implementation was the adoption of the REST architectural style, because it is suitable for achieving three important goals: independent deployment of components, ease of standardised communication between components and generality of interfaces. These advantages will enable the development and integration of additional algorithms in the future, which may be offered by a variety of third-party developers in the community. Ongoing maintenance and addition of novel predictive algorithms relevant to predictive toxicology will contribute to the long-term sustainability of OpenTox in generating valuable resources for the user scientific community.</p>
          <p>Many descriptor calculation algorithms and QSAR modelling methods have already been implemented and incorporated within OpenTox. These include methods provided by OpenTox partners and algorithms contained in other state-of-the-art projects such as WEKA and CDK. Descriptor calculation algorithms are able to generate both physico-chemical and sub-structural descriptors. QSAR modelling methods cover a wide range of approaches and address many user model building requirements, since they include regression and classification algorithms, eager and lazy approaches, and algorithms producing more easily interpretable and understandable models. The initial prototype also includes implementations of clustering algorithms and feature selection tools. Within OpenTox we have also implemented basic validation routines, simple validation (with supplied test set or training/test split), cross-validation routines (including leave-one-out), as well as making initial reporting routines available.</p>
          <p>The OpenTox Framework supports rapid application development and extensibility by using well-defined ontologies, allowing simplified communication between individual components. Two user-centered prototype applications, ToxCreate and ToxPredict, show the potential impact of the framework regarding high-quality and consistent structure-activity relationship modelling of REACH relevant endpoints. The applications have been made available publically on the Web [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] providing immediate access to the applications as they have been developed. Considerable additional materials and references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>] have been provided with this paper to support as complete a description of OpenTox as possible for users and developers.</p>
          <p>ToxPredict satisfies a common and important situation for a user wishing to evaluate the toxicity of a chemical structure. The user does not have to cope with many current challenges such as the difficulty of finding or using existing data or the complications of creating and using complicated computer models. Because of the extensible nature of the standardised design of the OpenTox Framework, many new datasets and models from other researchers may be easily incorporated in the future, both strengthening the value offered to the user and ensuring that research results are not left languishing unused in some isolated resource not accessible to the user. The approach offers the potential to be extended to the complete and easy-to-use generation of reporting information on all REACH-relevant endpoints based on existing available scientific research results, and indications when additional experimental work is required, thus satisfying currently unmet industry and regulatory needs.</p>
          <p>ToxCreate provides a resource to modellers to build soundly-based predictive toxicology models, basely solely on a user-provided input toxicology dataset that can be uploaded through a web browser. The models can be built and validated in an automated and scientifically sound manner, so as to ensure that the predictive capabilities and limitations of the models can be examined and understood clearly. Models can subsequently be easily made available to other researchers and combined seamlessly into other applications through the OpenTox Framework.</p>
          <p>Continuing effort will be carried out by OpenTox developers to meet current academic and industry challenges regarding interoperability of software components and integration of algorithm and model services within the context of tested Use Cases. The approach to interoperability and standards lays a solid foundation to extend application development within the broader developer community to establish computing capabilities that are sorely missing in the field of predictive toxicology today, and which are holding back advances in both R&amp;D and the application of R&amp;D project outcomes to meet industry and regulatory needs.</p>
