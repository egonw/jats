            <p id="Par1">Sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) is a solute carrier responsible for active glucose absorption. SGLT1 is present in both the renal tubules and small intestine. In contrast, the closely related sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), a protein that is targeted in the treatment of diabetes type II, is only expressed in the renal tubules. Although dual inhibitors for both SGLT1 and SGLT2 have been developed, no drugs on the market are targeted at decreasing dietary glucose uptake by SGLT1 in the gastrointestinal tract. Here we aim at identifying SGLT1 inhibitors in silico by applying a machine learning approach that does not require structural information, which is absent for SGLT1. We applied proteochemometrics by implementation of compound- and protein-based information into random forest models. We obtained a predictive model with a sensitivity of 0.64âÂ±â0.06, specificity of 0.93âÂ±â0.01, positive predictive value of 0.47âÂ±â0.07, negative predictive value of 0.96âÂ±â0.01, and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.49âÂ±â0.05. Subsequent to model training, we applied our model in virtual screening to identify novel SGLT1 inhibitors. Of the 77 tested compounds, 30 were experimentally confirmed for SGLT1-inhibiting activity in vitro, leading to a hit rate of 39% with activities in the low micromolar range. Moreover, the hit compounds included novel molecules, which is reflected by the low similarity of these compounds with the training set (&lt;â0.3). Conclusively, proteochemometric modeling of SGLT1 is a viable strategy for identifying active small molecules. Therefore, this method may also be applied in detection of novel small molecules for other transporter proteins.<fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13321_2019_337_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" /></fig></p>

          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p id="Par11">Sodium-dependent glucose co-transporters, or sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLTs), are solute carriers (SLCs) that are responsible for glucose (re)absorption. SGLTs are members of the sodium-dependent transporters and are encoded by the SLC5A genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. SGLTs are interesting targets in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, as their inhibition reduces the risk of hyperglycemia by decreasing glucose (re-)uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the human body two SGLT isoforms are involved in glucose transport: SGLT1 and SGLT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Both SGLT1 and SGLT2 are expressed in the kidney, whereas SGLT1 is also expressed in the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. SGLT2 is a high capacity transporter responsible for 90% of glucose reuptake in the renal tubules and multiple compounds have been developed that inhibit this solute carrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibition has been shown to decrease blood glucose levels in diabetes type 2 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In contrast to SGLT2, SGLT1 is a low-capacity glucose transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, SGLT1 has a higher glucose affinity than SGLT2 and is additionally capable of transporting galactose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Dual inhibitors blocking both SGLT1 and SGLT2 are currently in clinical development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In line with previous evidence we suggest that SGLT1 inhibition in the intestine will lower blood glucose levels as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Compounds that do not penetrate the intestinal wall can achieve selective targeting of SGLT1 in the intestine, as they would not reach the renal tubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
          <p id="Par12">The complexity and the hydrophobic nature of transporter proteins make them challenging to crystalize. Crystal structures of transporters are scarce and binding locations of small molecules to these transporters are often unknown. For human SGLTs no protein structures are available negating the use of structure-based modeling techniques. However, the publicly available compound database ChEMBL includes ligandâprotein binding information for multiple SGLTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], allowing the use of statistical modeling techniques such as quantitative structureâactivity relationship analysis (QSAR) and proteochemometrics (PCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These techniques, which make use of machine learning, do not require protein structural information and can therefore be applied in the context of SLCs. Although ligand-based pharmacophore modeling, QSAR, and PCM have only been applied to a few SLCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], these techniques are well established on other drug targets including membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
          <p id="Par13">Unfortunately, the publicly available compound interaction data for SGLTs is limited from the point of chemical diversity as the major share of ligands are glycoside-like compounds and oxopyrrolidine-carboxamides. This limited chemical space hence restricts the applicability domain of QSAR and PCM models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The applicability domain of computational models can be interpreted as the theoretical ensemble of molecular structures to which a model can be applied accurately. This domain is dependent on the model input and can therefore be quantified by similarity with the training molecules.</p>
          <p id="Par14">In the current work we show how we expanded the chemical space of SGLT inhibitors (using an in-house dataset [Oranje et al. manuscript in preparation]), and with that the applicability domain of our SGLT models. We constructed PCM models based on SGLT1 and its closest family members to predict compound activity for SGLT1. We successfully identified novel SGLT1 inhibitors that display low similarity towards the training set.</p>

            <title>SGLT chemical space</title>
            <p id="Par15">A public dataset was created based on ChEMBL version 23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] which includes the target protein human SGLT1 (hSGLT1), related protein human SGLT2 (hSGLT2), and multiple other SGLTs from different species. The public dataset encompassed 2063 data points and 1683 unique compounds, of which 886 compounds had measured hSGLT1 activities. Additionally, this set was supplemented with an in-house dataset of 2007 molecules previously screened for hSGLT1 and hSGLT2 inhibition [Oranje et al. manuscript in preparation]. This in-house dataset is based on the Spectrum Collection compound library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] extended with compounds similar to primary screening hits and contained natural products and synthetic compounds. The data derived from ChEMBL was compared to the in-house dataset: the in-house dataset contained an additional 2005 hSGLT1 activities and 140 hSGLT2 activities, which were not present in the public dataset. The difference between the public and in-house dataset is graphically represented with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1 for graph color-coded on proteins). T-SNE was applied to decrease the high dimensionality of the datasets, making it possible to visualize them in 2D. The high dimensions are a consequence of the many descriptors that are used to describe the data, i.e. FCFP6 fingerprints. The t-SNE plot shows that the data derived for proteins similar to hSGLT1 extend the chemical space; many hSGLT2 compounds from the public domain are not tested on hSGLT1 and thus provide additional chemical information. The in-house and public datasets considerably differ from each other, with a slight overlap of only a few hSGLT1 and hSGLT2 public compounds with the in-house dataset. To further investigate the difference between the public and in-house dataset, the following physicochemical properties were considered: molecular weight, ALogP, and number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. The publicly available data represented mainly the drug-like space, following Lipinskiâs rule of five, likely resulting from the fact that hSGLT2 is a drug target investigated by pharmaceutical companies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, the public data mostly includes glycoside-like compounds and oxopyrrolidine-carboxamides. In contrast, the in-house dataset encompasses more diverse molecules and captures a wider value range for the physicochemical properties mentioned above. The molecular weight and ALogP are represented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, where it is observed that these properties are more conserved for the public dataset than for the in-house dataset. Additionally, the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors is lower on average but more diverse in the in-house dataset (mean and standard deviation): public dataset hydrogen bond donor 3.6âÂ±â1.6 (vs 2.0âÂ±â2.6 for the in house set), hydrogen bond acceptor 6.3âÂ±â1.8 (vs 5.1âÂ±â4.1 for in the in house set). When screening for compounds to target hSGLT1 in the intestine, it is favorable to consider compounds that do not necessarily adhere to Lipinskiâs rule of five, as it is preferred to minimize compound absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the in-house dataset contributes substantially to the applicability domain and relevant chemical space for the statistical SGLT model.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Chemical space of the public and in-house datasets. <bold>a</bold> The t-SNE shows molecular structure and affinity (pK<sub>i</sub> for public data and % of (negative) control for in-house data) for representative hSGLT1 compounds. <bold>b</bold> Molecular weight and ALogP distribution of compounds in the training sets</p></caption><graphic specific-use="HTML" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13321_2019_337_Fig1_HTML.png" /></fig></p>

            <title>Merging different datasets</title>
            <p id="Par16">To merge the public and in-house dataset the difference in activity units for both sets had to be resolved. The public dataset contains pChEMBL values, representing a standardized unit for affinity and potency values such as K<sub>i</sub>, IC<sub>50</sub>, EC<sub>50</sub>, and K<sub>d</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The potency values in the in-house dataset were available as percentage activity compared to (negative) control at a concentration of 50Â Î¼M, which could not be converted into a pChEMBL value. Hence, binary classification models were chosen over regression.</p>
            <p id="Par17">Thresholds for compounds being âactiveâ were determined by grid searching cut-off values for both the public and in-house data. Activity thresholds along the grid were reviewed using hSGLT1 QSARs and external validation with a hold-out test set containing 30% of the in-house hSGLT1 data. The public domain compounds, which are mostly glycoside-like compounds and oxopyrrolidine-carboxamides, only describe a very conserved and small chemical space. However, the molecules of interest belonged to the same chemical space as the more diverse in-house compounds and therefore only compounds from the in-house set were used in validation. The activity threshold grid search showed that an activity threshold optimum for the in-house data was found at activity percentage of negative controlâ&lt;â70%,â&lt;â75%, andâ&lt;â80% together with the threshold for public data set at pChEMBLâ>â8.5 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In further models (see research workflow in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Figure S2) the activity threshold was set at activityâ&lt;â70% for in-house data and pChEMBLâ>â8.5 for public data to achieve the best performance for predicting hSGLT1 active molecules in the chemical space of the in-house compounds. Although these activity thresholds are not similar toward each other (e.g. pChEMBLâ>â8.5 corresponds to an in-house threshold much lower than 70%), these thresholds were determined optimal for the aim, which is the identification of novel (weak) actives that are similar in chemical space as the in-house compounds. The performance of the QSAR benchmark model using the selected thresholds was: sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.86, positive predictive value (PPV) 0.42, negative predictive value (NPV) 0.96, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) 0.48.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.Â 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Activity threshold grid search.

            <title>Proteochemometric modeling of hSGLT1</title>
            <p id="Par18">A PCM model was constructed using only public data to predict the inhibitory activity of compounds for hSGLT1. The performance of the model was tested on in-house data as these compounds represented the chemical space of interest. The model was validated using five test sets composed from in-house hSGLT1 data (5âÃâ20%). The mean performance of the public data model was very poor (mean with standard deviation): sensitivity 0.01âÂ±â0.01, specificity 0.98âÂ±â0.00, PPV 0.03âÂ±â0.06, NPV 0.91âÂ±â0.01, and MCC -0.03âÂ±â0.03 (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This demonstrates that with public data alone it was impossible to identify active compounds and the model defaulted to classification of all compounds as âinactiveâ. This behavior confirms the large differences in chemical space between the two sets as alluded to above.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>TableÂ 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Model performance depends on datasets that are used in training</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Model and validation</p></th><th align="left"><p>Training</p></th><th align="left"><p>Sensitivity</p></th><th align="left"><p>Specificity</p></th><th align="left"><p>PPV</p></th><th align="left"><p>NPV</p></th><th align="left"><p>MCC</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>QSAR (EV)</p></td><td align="left"><p>PDâ+âIH</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.76</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.86</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.42</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.96</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.48</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Public PCM (CV)</p></td><td align="left"><p>PD</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.01âÂ±â0.01</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.98âÂ±â0.00</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.03âÂ±â0.06</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.91âÂ±â0.01</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>ââ0.03âÂ±â0.03</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>In-house PCM (CV)</p></td><td align="left"><p>IH</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.69âÂ±â0.07</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.89âÂ±â0.02</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.38âÂ±â0.06</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.97âÂ±â0.01</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.45âÂ±â0.05</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Combined PCM (CV)</p></td><td align="left"><p>PDâ+âIH</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.64âÂ±â0.06</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.93âÂ±â0.01</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.47âÂ±â0.07</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.96âÂ±â0.01</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.49âÂ±â0.05</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>PD</italic> public data, <italic>IH</italic> in-house data, <italic>EV</italic> external validation on 30% of data, <italic>CV</italic> fivefold cross validation on 20% of the data per iteration</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
            <p id="Par19">Next, a PCM model was constructed based on the combined full data set consisting of all public and in-house data. To validate the performance of this model, fivefold cross-validation was applied with the same test sets as applied in validation of performance of the public data model: rotationally 20% of the in-house hSGLT1 data was used as holdout test set; the remaining 80% was used in training. In each case the test set contained compounds not available for training. This resulted in the following performance: sensitivity 0.64âÂ±â0.06, specificity 0.93âÂ±â0.01, PPV 0.47âÂ±â0.07, NPV 0.96âÂ±â0.01, and MCC 0.49âÂ±â0.05. Overall performance of this PCM model was regarded satisfactory for predictions of new compounds and was comparable with the QSAR benchmark model used for activity threshold determination previously.</p>
            <p id="Par20">Additionally the performance of models trained on in-house data only was tested to assess the effect of addition of public data. Public domain compounds contributed slightly to the predictive performance of the model in specificity, PPV, and MCC. This was observed by a minor decrease in performance upon removal of the public data from the training set: sensitivity 0.69âÂ±â0.07, specificity 0.89âÂ±â0.02, PPV 0.38âÂ±â0.06, NPV 0.97âÂ±â0.01, and MCC 0.45âÂ±â0.05. Although the difference in performances is not significant, it is remarkable that the number of false positives decreases considerably when public data is included in training, whereas the number of true positives is only slightly negatively affected: false positives 28âÂ±â6 versus 43âÂ±â6, true positives 24âÂ±â4 versus 26âÂ±â4 (with and without public data, respectively). Apparently, the public data by itself is not sufficient in predicting hSGLT1 activity in the chemical space of the in-house compounds but does add favorably to model performance when supplemented to the in-house dataset.</p>

            <title>Screening for hSGLT1 actives in a commercially available compound library</title>
            <p id="Par21">The SGLT PCM model that was trained on public and in-house data was applied to a commercially available library. This library, the Enamine high-throughput screening (HTS) library, contains over 1.8 million compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The library covers a wide diversity regarding molecular weight and ALogP values, and encompasses a vast chemical space (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). With the PCM model (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>), an hSGLT1 activity prediction was assigned to all 1,815,674 compounds in the library (model training time was 103Â s; the screening speed was approximately 132Â s for 10,000 compounds). 155,275 compounds were predicted to be in the active class based on a predicted class probability ofââ¥â0.5 (score, proportion of votes of the trees in the ensemble).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.Â 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Chemical space of the selected compounds compared to the training and screening datasets. <bold>a</bold> The Diverse set (yellow) and Cluster set (green) are displayed compared to the training (orange and red) and Enamine screening set (blue).

            <p id="Par22">To increase confidence in the activity of compounds the screened set was pre-filtered by selecting compounds with a predicted class probability ofââ¥â0.8 on a scale from 0 to 1. Here, a resulting score of 1 represents compounds predicted to be in the âactiveâ class, a score of 0 indicates that the compounds are predicted âinactiveâ; ascending scores indicate higher certainty of compounds belonging to the âactiveâ class. Additionally, compounds with molecular weightââ¤â300 were removed to exclude fragment-like compounds. The final filtered set contained 672 compounds.</p>
            <p id="Par23">Based on the model predictions, 40 chemically diverse compounds predicted to be active were selected for experimental in vitro validation (âDiverse setâ). The compounds in this set were cluster centers resulting from clustering of the remaining predicted active compounds into 40 clusters. This diverse set was selected to increase the probability of detecting chemically novel hSGLT1 inhibitors. The selected compounds distributed widely through chemical space (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S4), thus providing a challenging test for the SGLT PCM model. In addition to screening for novel hSGLT1 inhibitors, compounds were selected to expand the SAR around some recently identified hSGLT1 inhibitors from the in-house dataset [Oranje et al., manuscript in preparation]. Based on four hSGLT1 inhibitors (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) 3âÃâ10 additional compounds were selected from the pre-filtered Enamine HTS set that were predicted to be active (with top ranking scores) and that resembled bepridil, bupivacaine, and cloperastine. Furthermore 7 compounds were selected resembling trihexyphenidyl (âCluster setâ). These compounds were selected based on both model prediction (predicted class probabilityââ¥â0.8) and the highest similarity (Tanimoto, FCFP6) towards their known reference compound.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.Â 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Reference hSGLT1 inhibitors for Cluster set and their inhibitory activity.

            <p id="Par25">The potential cytotoxicity of the screening compounds (Diverse set and Cluster set) was investigated by analysis of secreted adenylate kinase (AK), a marker of cell wall integrity loss. Most compounds did not show any indication of cyotoxicity, however one active from the Diverse set displayed moderate impairment of the cell wall (Z1416510792: activity 43âÂ±â9%, cytotoxicity 25%). The cytotoxicity assay was limited by the available supernatant from the activity screen. Therefore not all compounds were measured in duplicate and cytotoxicity of one active from the Cluster set could not be determined (Z817504494: activity 45âÂ±â3%).</p>

            <p id="Par26">Both the Diverse set and Cluster set compounds were additionally measured for hSGLT2 inhibitory activity to assess their selectivity between the two transporters. The same cellular screening assay was performed as was used for hSGLT1 (single point measurement at a concentration of 50Â Î¼M). More actives were defined for hSGLT2 compared to hSGLT1 using the same activity threshold of 70% activity relative to negative control (100%: no inhibition): 22 actives in the Diverse set and 19 in the Cluster set. Almost all hSGLT1 actives showed activity for hSGLT2 with the possible exception of Z105569118, which only marginally surpassed the activity threshold for hSGLT2 (activity of hSGLT1 64âÂ±â4% and hSGLT2 76âÂ±â5%). No selective compounds were identified for hSGLT1, with 14% being the highest observed difference in inhibition (Z46160496: hSGLT1 41âÂ±â4% and hSGLT2 55âÂ±â2%). For hSGLT2 the biggest difference in inhibition was found for Z1318177320 that showed a difference of 39% (hSGLT1 93âÂ±â20% and hSGLT2 54âÂ±â0%).</p>

            <title>Hit compound analysis</title>
            <p id="Par27">The activities of the hit compounds of the Diverse and Cluster set were analyzed. The strongest inhibitors, Z163972344 and Z915954934, were derived from the Diverse set with activities of 24âÂ±â1% and 28âÂ±â4% (100%: no inhibition), respectively. Z163972344 has low similarity (0.27 based on Tanimoto FCFP6) with the training set, indicating that this is a truly novel inhibitor for hSGLT1. The average similarity of actives in the Diverse set compared to training was 0.33, with Z1416510792 being the active that is most similar to the compounds in the training set with a similarity score of 0.61 (this compound showed moderate AK secretion in the cytotoxicity assay).</p>
            <p id="Par28">For the Cluster set a total of 15 actives were validated for the four different clusters. The cloperastine cluster encompassed the most actives (60% actives), whereas the trihexyphenidyl and bepridil clusters contained the least actives with 29% and 30% actives, respectively. The bupivacaine cluster had an intermediate hit rate of 40%, which is comparable with the overall hit rate of the total Cluster set (41%). The variance in hit rates between the four clusters is also reflected in the similarity of compounds toward their cluster reference: the cloperastine and bupivacaine clusters contained the most similar compounds (average similarities towards cluster reference compound were 0.43 and 0.42, respectively); the trihexyphenidyl and bepridil clusters contained less similar compounds (0.35 and 0.31, respectively).</p>
            <p id="Par29">Although the cloperastine and bupivacaine clusters contained the most similar cluster members, no conclusive SAR could be determined. The cluster members displayed variations in methyl substituents, which showed an effect for two compounds in the bupivacaine cluster [Z46224544 (45âÂ±â10%) and Z2217101732 (74âÂ±â8%)]. This was however not observed for compounds in the cloperastine cluster: Z31367782 (36âÂ±â4%), Z31371621 (37âÂ±â3%), Z31367784 (43âÂ±â7%), and Z31370217 (45âÂ±â10%). The positions of the methyl substituents were too distinct to make solid conclusions on their relationship with compound activity.</p>
            <p id="Par30">In general, the novel active entities contain at least one aromatic ring and two hydrogen bond acceptors. Only two of the 30 actives did not adhere to Lipinskiâs rule of five, with an ALogP of 5.2 and 6.2 for Z1844922248 (activity 49âÂ±â7%) and Z56906862 (activity 38âÂ±â5%), respectively.</p>

            <title>Aiming for specific targeting at the gastrointestinal tract</title>
            <p id="Par31">As mentioned in the Introduction, hSGLT1 inhibition at the intestinal wall is desired. Based on chemical structure and physicochemical properties the identified hit compounds will most likely be absorbed. However, it is suggested that modifications can be introduced to improve specific intestinal targeting. These alterations, such as a higher molecular weight, can prevent compounds from being absorbed or transported by the intestinal wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Intestinal SGLT1 blockers are expected to display less renal damage, which is an adverse effect observed for SGLT2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, drug action restricted to the gastrointestinal tract also limits other off-target interactions, which were observed for the marketed SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. An example of a compound that was optimized for specific targeting at the gastrointestinal tract is LX2761, an inhibitor aimed at intestinal SGLT1 that decreased glucose uptake in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

            <title>Indications for alternate binding modes</title>
            <p id="Par32">Upon examination of our hSGLT1 actives, a large variety in chemical structure and physicochemical properties was observed. This indicates that different ligand types may bind to different sites on hSGLT1. It is speculated that the glycoside-like hSGLT1 inhibitors, which are represented well in the public compound domain, bind to the glucose binding site, whereas more chemically diverse hSGLT1 inhibitors are suggested to bind either there or elsewhere on the protein. The hSGLT1 actives were grouped into ten clusters. Here, the activity threshold for compounds from the public dataset was pChEMBLââ¥â6.5 to include all actives instead of only strong binders (pChEMBLâ>â8.5, which gave the best model performance). It was observed that the glycoside-like compounds cluster together in cluster 2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Furthermore, the oxopyrrolidine-carboxamide compounds, which are also present in the public domain, are gathered in cluster 7. Cluster 4 mainly holds in-house compounds and includes the anti-histamine drug moxastine and antidepressant amitriptyline besides cloperastine. The differences in chemical structure, molecular weight, and ALogP of the clusters substantiate the possible existence of multiple binding sites. As a further example, cluster 6 differs considerably in ALogP from the other clusters. This suggests that the compounds in this cluster bind to a more hydrophilic site. The cluster centers and distribution of molecular weight, ALogP, number of hydrogen bond donors, and number of hydrogen bond acceptors for all clusters are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Figure S7. Additional pharmacological experiments, beyond the scope of this study, are warranted to further investigate the existence of multiple binding pockets in SGLT1. Attempts have been made to explore the binding sites of SGLT1 for substrates and inhibitor phloridzin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although the SGLT structure of <italic>vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> has been used to generate hypotheses on SGLT1 binding pockets, the lack of an hSGLT1 structure hampers the detection of potential allosteric binding pockets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.Â 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Clustering of hSGLT1 actives.

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p id="Par33">We have demonstrated that PCM modeling is a viable method to identify novel inhibitors for solute carrier hSGLT1 and hence likely any solute carrier protein. A predictive SGLT model was built with a MCC value of 0.49âÂ±â0.05, estimated with fivefold cross-validation. With the optimized model a hit rate of 38% was achieved when it was applied to screen for diverse molecules (Diverse set). In parallel, the model was used to boost identification of actives with a given chemotype (Cluster set). Although additional active compounds were identified, the data was too ambiguous to gain insight into the SAR of hSGLT1 inhibitors.</p>
          <p id="Par34">Diversity was found within the in-house dataset and differences were observed between the in-house chemical space and that of the public dataset. Furthermore, the intrinsic variety in chemical structure of active compounds implies that there may be multiple binding sites at the transporter protein.</p>
          <p id="Par35">The novel identified inhibitors showed low similarity towards the training set and belong to the same chemical space of the in-house dataset, in contrast to the public dataset. Although the inhibitors were not optimized for specific drug delivery to the gastrointestinal tract, it is suggested that alterations (such as an increase in molecular weight and size) can make these inhibitors selective for intestinal hSGLT1.</p>
